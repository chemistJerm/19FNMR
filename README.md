19F NMR Spectral Database Files

Data for manuscript es-2023-01220t.R2

This repository contains data related to the manuscript “Identifying unknown fluorine-containing compounds in environmental samples using 19F NMR and spectral database matching” by Jeremy R. Gauthier and Scott A. Mabury

All NMR spectra have been taken from the Agilent/Varian-generated FID files and added directly into MestreNova including all relevant experimental parameter files. Spectra have had automatic baseline correction applied (Full Auto Whittaker-Smoother), automatic phase correction, and chemical shifts have been adjusted to centre on -105.7303 ppm.

Where the spectra contain chemical structures and peak assignments, these structures are imported from Chemdraw version 19.1 directly into the spectral file, and peak assignments performed manually.

Orbitrap HRMS .raw files are included for the Lake Niapenco extract and corresponding blank. MS/MS data is automatically processed using Waters Targetlynx software for peak picking and integration, and the export from the TargetLynx data is included as an Excel file.
